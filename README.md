# Stackathon - Issa Restaurant Vibe

Did you ever want to know what the vibe is like at a restaurant BEFORE you get there? 

Yelp stars indicate a general affinity but if you wanted a 'get a vibe' without reading the reviews, a sentiment score based on customer reviews will give you a snapshot of what the recent vibe is like at a specific restaurant.

Just grab a Yelp restaurant page link and enter it into the search bar!

Get a sentiment analysis on the recent restaurant reviews & save yourself the time you would spent reading a review!
